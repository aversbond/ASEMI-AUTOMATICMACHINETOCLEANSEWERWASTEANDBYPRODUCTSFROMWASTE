\begin{frame}{PROBLEM DOMAIN}
	1. Clean water and sanitation
	
	2. Affordable and clean energy
	
	3. Good health and wellbeing
	
	4. Life on land

\begin{frame}{INTRODUCTION}
	
	Every city or town is developing, the population of that city is also increasing. So,the city waste is also increasing day by day. To clean the whole city waste the sewer cleaners have face many problems. Some problems are they have to dip in the sewer line to clean the waste, because of that htey face many diseases. The whole waste is stagged in the outskirts of the city or town which looks very dirty.  
	
	So, in order to solve the problems of the sewer cleaner a semi automatic machine is make which is controlled by the sewer cleaners. The sewer cleaner dip the machine part into the drain to clean it. And the whole waste which is stagged in the outskrits of the city is further used to produce by products.

\begin{frame}{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
	Worker have to dip in the drain to clean drains and stroage of waste in the outskirsts of the city

\begin{frame}{CAUSE AND EFFECTS}
	1. They have no proper equipments so the sewer cleaners won't able to reach the waste.
	
	2. They have to dip in the drain to reach the waste so they face many health issues.
	
	3. Waste from the sewer line are stagged beside the road which cause reduce in road area.

	4. Animals eat the stagged waste which create many health issues.

	\begin{frame}{CUSTOMER REASEARCH}
	During customer we visited the place where the whole city waste is stagged. We talked with the sewer cleaners and asked some question to them. The questions are as follows-
	
	1. Does the tools are perfect to use?
	
	= No ,the tools are not perfect to clean the drain with help of it.
	
	2. Did you have to dip in the drain?
	
	= Yes, just because the tools are not perfect ,we have to dip in the drain and clean it manually.
	
	3. Where does the whole waste staged?
	
	= the whole waste is staged in the outskirts of the city.
	
	4. Which tool is better to clean drain?
	
	= A tool which help us not to clean the drain manually will be a good one.

	\begin{frame}{MARKET REASEARCH}
		To avoid manual scavenging an automatic robot is introduced earlier. It is done in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to clean manholes. The robot is consisting of hands, legs and a bucket of 18 litre. The hand goes inside the manhole. The legs help the robot to reach the waste. And the bucket is used to carry out the waste which is collected. The robot is also consisting of many other parts such as various sensors to measure environmental parameters, temperature of the manhole, size of the manhole, etc. A camera is also installed in the robot to observe during night.

    \begin{frame}{ATOMIC UNIT AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR}
	   Our atomic unit is-
	   \newline
	   To avoid manual scavenging and to make byproduct from sewer waste.
	   
	   
	   
	   Our key performance indicator are-
	   
	   After  how much time sewer line is filled with waste?
	   
	 	In how much time it will take to clean a block?
	   
	   How much waste it take out off at a time?
	   
	   How much amount of sewer waste is collected per day?
	   
	   How much amount of byproduct is formed per day?
	    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{IMPLEMENTATION}
    	A machine which is operated by the sewer cleaners, is taken and installed in the track which is developed in the drain. After fixing the machine in the track an aluminium bucket is ready to dip in the drain to take all the waste out. After doing this the machine is ready to clean the drain. When the bucket is filled, the bucket moves 90 degree and it came out from the drain . After coming out ,the sewer cleaner make the bucket an airtight container. And the container is taken up, to produce the methane gas from the waste as byproduct. After producing methane gas the residue is used as manure. And the plastic materials obtained from the waste is used to build roads .
